portfolio represents so much of person personality and character so that's why I chose it to talk on behalf of me.
it helped me share my knowledge in a professional way and in a way that is simple and efficient at the same time 

For my portfolio I used wireframe and mockup and some coding languages that I found so user friendly and helped my design a great and accessible portfolio these coding languages include :

2) media query
3) HTML
4) CSS
5) bootstrap
